CDNs not only load eCommerce website pages more quickly but also support more users without any glitches. They can simultaneously redirect traffic of busy servers to other servers for better balance, reduce local network traffic congestion, and prevent single-point server failures. The advantages of CDNs are immense in Shopify Theme Development. Let’s see them.

- They eliminate long wait times for content download, buffering, and live streaming, which results in a better user experience. 
  Geographical distribution of content via multiple servers shortens distances between network paths and removes local network bottlenecks. This decreases bandwidth needs and improves network usage. 
  Edge server distribution allows a Shopify development company to support more users than expected, allowing them to create a highly scalable webstore. 
  CDNs multiply the number of Points of Access that prevent DDoS attacks, leading to a much more secure web solution. CDNs also come with additional security walls, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
  If a Shopify website development company aims to focus on content delivery in a certain geography, say Australia and New Zealand, CDN’s smart deployment, leveraging process automation, enhances website performance in those areas. 
- The servers can also limit content access in other areas with simple web configuration.
